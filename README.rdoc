Implemented:
* Handles users
* Handles bands (subset of users)
* Has songs (songs can be public/private and belong to certain users)
* Added bootstrap

To implement (priority):
* Bands can upload songs
* Show page only shows songs for band users
* change routing to show band names instead of user_id
* Add testing for everything (oops)

* Add albums and artwork
* Add track number (and ordering) 
* Add javascript
* Add bios to users 
* Add user listing page
* Make the site prettier 
* Tidy up and refactor code whenever possible
